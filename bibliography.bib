abstract={Automation of harvesting machines is crucial for achieving and maintaining the best possible machine performance over a variety of crop types, crop conditions, and agronomic conditions. Operator assistant systems like automatic steering and feed-rate control helps the operator to focus more on surveillance and controlling the overall harvesting process. Adding real-time perception sensing capabilities combined with site specific geospatial information and operator learning technologies further improves and enhances automation solutions and enables future fully autonomous agricultural machines. In this paper, a novel predictive feedrate control system is introduced which fuses existing machine feedback sensors with spatial biomass and crop condition information provided by an optical sensor system and geospatial data. Forward-looking speed planning allows the use of spatial information in accordance to time-based machine propulsion and crop processing dynamics. Model predictive optimization balances between set-point tracking accuracy and operator comfort to enable the best machine performance and user experience. Â© VDI Verlag GmbH Â· DÃ¼sseldorf 2019.},

abstract={A vision-based row guidance method is presented to guide a robot platform which is designed independently to drive through the row crops in a field according to the design concept of open architecture. Then, the offset and heading angle of the robot platform are detected in real time to guide the platform on the basis of recognition of a crop row using machine vision. And the control scheme of the platform is proposed to carry out row guidance. Finally, the preliminary experiments of row guidance were implemented in a vegetable field. Experimental results show that algorithms of row identification and row guidance are effective according to the parameters measured and analyzed such as the heading angle and the offset for row guidance and the difference between the motion trajectory of the robot and the expected trajectory. And the accuracy of row guidance is up to Â± 35mm, which means that the robot can move with a sufficiently high accuracy. Â© 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={Autonomous agriculture robot is one of the promising solutions for precision agriculture. This paper presents the proposed sensor and vision based agricultural robot for sowing seeds. This prototype can navigate it on any agricultural land and perform seed sowing operation simultaneously. The onboard sensors along with vision system and vision based approaches achieves the navigation and localization tasks. Self-awareness of the robot's position is determined by the global and local maps generated from Global Positioning System (GPS) and on-board vision system paired with a personal computer. This paper also presents the proposed sensor based precision seed metering and sowing mechanism. The proposed robot is a micro planter whose primary task would be to sow seeds at prefixed seeding intervals in the field. The dimensions of the proposed robot are 26.5 Ã— 18.5 Ã— 19.65 mm as L Ã— B Ã— H respectively. A suspension system has been used to maintain the stability of the vehicle and prevent it from toppling in motion. Â© 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={The aim of the paper was to present results of the vision system for plants/weeds classification testing of autonomous robot for sowing and wide row planting. Autonomous work of the robot in range of traction and agronomic processes will be implemented on the basis of data from a many sensors (cameras, position and distance). Positive test results will allow for the use of the robot in organic crops requiring mechanical removal of weeds or in crops with application of selective liquid agrochemicals limited to the minimum. Unless the control systems are improved and development costs are compensated, the production of autonomous agricultural systems will increase. So that very important is mentioned in this paper, vision system of plant/weed classification. The vision system for sugar beet/weed and sweet corn/weed classification was build and tested. The position of each plant must be determined for intra-row weeding. This means that plants have to be classified into two classes, i.e., sugar beet (sweet corn) or weed.
